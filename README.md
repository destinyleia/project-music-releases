# Music Releases

The project was to create a music listing site, similar to the New Releases section on Spotify – but this week we were introduced to React.

## The problem

We started by going through the brief to make sure we understood what was required from us. After that we took the knowledge we'd gotten from the tutorials and video lectures, and managed to extract the data and put it into React components. Once that was done (we struggled with the multiple artists part), we went on to styling, to make sure it looks like the reference designs.
